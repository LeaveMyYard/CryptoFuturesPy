## Overview

One day, I was tried to be messing with different interfaces of Binance, Bitmex and etc so I desided to create an interface for them and to make some implementations.

So, there exists only a Bitmex implementation now, but Binance Futures are coming.

## Installation

You can easily install it using 

```pip install crypto-futures-py``` 

and then access it in your Python code like that:

```from crypto_futures_py import BitmexExchangeHandler```

<!-- ## Documentation 

The documentation is [available here](http://day8.github.io/re-frame/). -->

## TODO

* Add Binance implementation
* Add a documentation


## Licence

CryptoFuturesPy is [MIT licenced](LICENSE.txt)
